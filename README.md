###### This is a README file explaining a repo and providing my Data Science profile from Unit 1.

 A "repo" represents a project's source code and is stored on GitHub's servers. Originally, "socially coded" computer programs were stored to make it easy for a number of collaborators to work together to build these programs. But the service
 has expanded beyond it's initial scope to provide a platform upon which a variety of researchers can 
 store, access, collaborate with others and version control their files. It facilitates the process of making
 research more reproducible.
